🎯 About Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful algorithm for classification, regression, and outlier detection. It is widely used in applications such as:

- Text Classification 📝

- Image Recognition 📸

- Spam Detection 📧

- Handwriting Identification ✍️

- Face Detection 😃

- Anomaly Detection 🚨

The main objective of SVM is to find an optimal hyperplane that separates data points into different classes efficiently, making it highly effective for prediction tasks.
