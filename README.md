# Diabetes-Prediction-System
Diabetes Prediction System designed using the Support Vector Machine Algorithm using the suitable features or attributes of the dataset.
The steps that were mainly involved in the development of this prediction system were as follows:
-Data Collection & Analysis
-Data Standardization 
-Training the Model
-Model Evaluation by computation of the accuracy score.
Finally,Building a Prediction System using numpy for prediction of the diabetes among the individuals.

SVM(Support Vector Machine):
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even outlier detection tasks. SVMs can be used for a variety of tasks, such as text classification, image classification, spam detection, handwriting identification, gene expression analysis, face detection, and anomaly detection. SVMs are adaptable and efficient in a variety of applications because they can manage high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships.
    The main objective of the SVM algorithm is to find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can separate the data points in different classes in the feature space.
